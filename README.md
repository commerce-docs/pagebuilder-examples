# Page Builder Examples

This repo is a collection of extended and custom content type modules created to teach you how to develop for Page Builder. The modules are designed to help you learn by example, and teach you best practices for extending and creating new content types for Page Builder.

## Installing the example modules

The best way to explore and use these example modules in Page Builder is to clone this repo into the root of your Magento instance, then symlink one or more modules into the `app/code/` directory, and run `setup:upgrade` to install. Step-by-step instructions follow.

1. Clone this repo (`pagebuilder-examples`) to the root of your Magento instance:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/commerce-docs/pagebuilder-examples.git
    ```

1. Navigate to the `app/code/` directory (or create one as needed), then use the symlink command to add one or more of the example modules you want to add to your instance. For example, to install the `Columns` module, use the following command from within the `app/code/` directory:

    ```bash
    ln -s ../../pagebuilder-examples/Columns
    ```

    This creates a symlink in `app/code/` called `Columns`, which references the `pagebuilder-examples/Columns` module.

    **To unlink a module**: Use the `unlink` (macOS) or `rm` command, followed by the path to the symlink. This example unlinks the `Columns` module from the `app/code/` directory:

    ```bash
    rm Columns
    ```

    Then you can run `bin/magento setup:upgrade` again to remove it from your Magento instance.

1. From the Magento root directory, run the `setup:upgrade` command to install and enable the symlinked modules:

   ```bash
   bin/magento setup:upgrade
   ```

1. Navigate to a CMS page and start using the module(s).
